            <h2>
                Imagine a utopia without negative thought by eliminating negative vocabulary.
            </h2>
            <p>
                In a world where cultural prohibition and internet censorship prevail, the regulation of speech remains
                an ongoing and deeply contentious issue. This speculative video work imagines a future where, in the
                name of collective well-being, society embraces brainwashing technologies to erase any words from the
                human mind that might trigger negative thoughts—sorrow, jealousy, pain, or conflict. In this sanitized
                world, emotional suffering is eliminated at its root. But at what cost?

        <h2>Chapter One</h2>
        <p>
            Alethia enters the underworld—a two-dimensional space where the forbidden words hide among
            relics. Banished and fragmented, they await rediscovery. Alethia begins to collect scattered letters,
            seeking to reconstruct the missing language with a sense of loss at heart. Only by reassembling
            these lost words can the world rebuilt into a third dimensional space.

        <h2>Chapter Two</h2>
        <p>
            Alethia descends via a playground slide into the reconditioning zone—a site of brainwashing where negative words are
            systematically dissolved and cast into the lower world. Here, emotions are cleansed alongside language,
            leaving behind only positive shells of thought.
