            <p>
                In traditional Chinese medicine, bone-setting (正骨) was a clinical practice for treating injuries and
                misalignments. Yet in recent years, its popularity has shifted—no longer driven by therapeutic need, but
                by the internet's pervasive cultivation of aesthetic anxiety. People have grown obsessed with skeletal
                symmetry, chasing an illusory ideal of "perfect" bones with almost religious fervor.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                This fixation is not unique to Eastern contexts. My research revealed a parallel distortion in Western
                osteopathy, where some undergo drastic limb-lengthening surgeries to gain height, sacrificing health for
                proportionality.

            <p>
                Blending these two phenomena, I designed "Osteomania"—a speculative system comprising a bone-correcting
                machine and wearable orthopedic devices—to critique humanity's pathological pursuit of anatomical
                "perfection."
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The machine, a grotesque fusion of medical apparatus and torture device, violently "adjusts" the body
                into symmetrical conformity, while the wearable exoskeleton perpetually enforces artificial alignment.
                Together, they literalize the self-punishing nature of aesthetic dogma, questioning: When does
                self-improvement become self-destruction? By exaggerating the absurdity of these practices, the work
                mirrors our escalating submission to digitally amplified dysmorphia.
